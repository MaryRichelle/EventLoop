## TECH INTERVIEW & JOB SEARCH

#### INTERVIEW FEEDBACK AND TIPS 

In general, the company is interviewing you as much as you are interviewing them. If you don't leave the interview knowing all the useful extra info about the company, you did not do a good enough job.

Things that you might want to ask about the company:

- Exact salary
- Working hours (can you work flexible hours?)
- Holidays
- Benefits
- Career growth (Does the company provide money for seminars? Is there room for learning in the company? etc.) 
- What is the stack? 
- What tools are they using? (e.g. for project managing, communication, etc.)
- Will you get support from the team? How does the team support entry-level developers?
- Will the company provide you with hardware or support you in case your hardware does not meet the requirements? What kind of setup do you need to have on your machine?
