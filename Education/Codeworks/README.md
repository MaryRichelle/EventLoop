TIP: For any kind of attack (XSS, CSRF), it might help you google for the term, and then switch to the `Images` Search tab. Most of the times, you'll find really helpful infographics or diagrams, depicting these attacks. They will nicely accompany the articles and documentation and give you a visual overview of the concepts.

### TECH INTERVIEW / JOB SEARCH 

#### INTERVIEW FEEDBACK AND TIPS 

In general, the company is interviewing you as much as you are interviewing them. If you don't leave the interview knowing all the useful extra info about the company, you did not do a good enough job.

Things that you might want to ask about the company:

- Exact salary
- Working hours (can you work flexible hours?)
- Holidays
- Benefits
- Career growth (Does the company provide money for seminars? Is there room for learning in the company? etc.) 
- What is the stack? 
- What tools are they using? (e.g. for project managing, communication, etc.)
- Will you get support from the team? How does the team support entry-level developers?
- Will the company provide you with hardware or support you in case your hardware does not meet the requirements? What kind of setup do you need to have on your machine?

    - "In certain situations (for example, when the service or its consumers are behind an overzealous corporate firewall, or if the main consumer is a web page), only the GET and POST HTTP methods might be available. In such a case, it is possible to emulate the missing verbs by passing a custom header in the requests." ~ [Source](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-a-restful/9781785285714/ch05s05.html)
